  <p id="ab"> ABOUT ME </p>
  <div align="center">
  <p id="lu"> I am a university student who attends the Communication Design course at the Politecnico of Milan. <br>
My passion is drawing and I dream of becoming a successful illustrator! <br>
<br> However, my path of study is making me appreciate many other jobs, such as that of videomaker. <br>
What I like about videomaking is that animations can have a close connection with music, which is another great passion of mine. <br>
<br> I always like to experiment different drawing techniques, but my main themes are about people and their relations with nature!</p>
